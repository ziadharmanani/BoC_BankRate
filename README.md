# Trend Analysis of Bank of Canada Policy Interest Rates 2025

## Overview
This project analyzes the Bank of Canada’s policy (bank) rate using historical data from Statistics Canada ([Source](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1010013901)).
The goal is to move beyond raw time series visualization and examine policy behavior, including the timing, direction, and frequency of rate changes. 
This project is exploratory and focuses on descriptive analysis. 
This project will be extended to include additional monetary and financial market variables such as the operating band, overnight money market financing rate (OMMF), Treasury bills, and Government of Canada bond yields.
